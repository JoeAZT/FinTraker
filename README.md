To Do List app created entirely in SwiftUI

This To Do list app is created entirely with SwiftUI. 
The purpose of this app was to experiment with the many exciting features that swiftUI has to offer as well as to showcase my UI skills.
It was also created for personal use as a means to stay productive and keep up a routine during the many lockdowns we have experienced.
